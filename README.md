# DesktopBuddy

A Resonite mod that spawns world-space desktop/window viewers with touch input, GPU-accelerated capture, remote streaming, and virtual camera/microphone output.

## Quick Start

1. Install [Resonite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2519830/Resonite/) with [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader)
2. Download the latest `DesktopBuddy.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/DevL0rd/DesktopBuddy/releases)
3. Extract into your Resonite root folder (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\`)
4. Launch Resonite
5. On first launch, you will get **two UAC prompts** (admin permission requests) to register the virtual camera and install the virtual microphone driver. **Accept both.**
6. **Restart your PC** after the first run — the virtual microphone driver requires a reboot to become active
7. Launch Resonite again and you're done! Open the context menu and select **Desktop** to get started

## First-Run Setup (Automatic)

DesktopBuddy automatically sets up virtual devices on the first launch:

| Step | What happens | User action |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Virtual camera registration | Registers "DesktopBuddy - Camera" DirectShow filter via `regsvr32` | Accept UAC prompt |
| Virtual microphone install | Installs VB-Cable virtual audio driver | Accept UAC prompt |

Both prompts may appear on your desktop monitor (behind VR). If you're in VR, check your desktop.

After accepting both prompts, **restart your PC**. The virtual microphone driver (VB-Cable) requires a reboot to become active. The virtual camera works immediately after a Resonite relaunch, but the mic needs a full restart.

On subsequent launches, no prompts will appear — the setup persists across updates.

## Troubleshooting

**Virtual camera "DesktopBuddy - Camera" not showing in Discord/Zoom/Chrome**
- Restart Resonite after the first-run setup
- Restart Discord/Zoom — they cache the device list at startup
- Check Windows Settings > Bluetooth & devices > Cameras to verify the device appears

**Virtual microphone "CABLE Output" not showing**
- Restart Resonite after the first-run setup
- If still missing, try a full PC restart — VB-Cable sometimes needs it
- Check Windows Settings > System > Sound > Input to verify "CABLE Output" appears

**Virtual camera shows black**
- Open a desktop window in DesktopBuddy first — the camera renders from the in-game camera on your panel
- Make sure a consumer app (Discord, etc.) has selected "DesktopBuddy - Camera" as its camera — the camera only renders when something is actively using it

**Virtual mic is silent**
- Make sure the mic indicator (small panel next to the camera) is **green** (unmuted). Click it to toggle.
- In Discord/Zoom, select **"CABLE Output"** as your microphone input
- The mic captures spatial in-game audio — make sure there are audio sources in the world

**Streaming not working for other users?**
- The mod runs a local HTTP server on port 48080. If streaming isn't working, run this command once as Administrator:
  ```
  netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:48080/ sddl="D:(A;;GX;;;S-1-1-0)"
  ```
  The mod tries to do this automatically on first run.

## Features

- **GPU-accelerated capture** via Windows.Graphics.Capture (WGC)
- **GPU BGRA-to-RGBA conversion** via D3D11 compute shader
- **Hardware H.264/HEVC encoding** via NVENC (NVIDIA) or AMF (AMD) through FFmpeg
- **Remote streaming** via MPEG-TS over Cloudflare Tunnel — other users see your desktop in VR
- **Per-window audio capture** via WASAPI process loopback
- **Virtual camera** — in-game camera view exposed as "DesktopBuddy - Camera" in Discord, Zoom, Chrome, OBS
- **Virtual microphone** — spatial in-game audio captured via AudioListener, routed to VB-Cable virtual mic for Discord/Zoom
- **Touch/mouse/keyboard input** injection from VR controllers
- **Child window detection** — popups and dialogs auto-spawn as separate panels
- **Context menu integration** — pick a window or monitor from the Resonite context menu
- **Auto-reconnecting Cloudflare tunnel** with error detection and restart

## Usage

1. In Resonite, open the context menu (right-click or equivalent VR gesture)
2. Select **Desktop** to open the window/monitor picker
3. Pick a window or monitor to spawn a viewer panel
4. Interact with the panel using VR controllers (touch, scroll, keyboard)
5. Other users in the session see the stream via Cloudflare Tunnel

### Virtual Camera

Each desktop panel has a small dark indicator mounted on top. When a consumer app (Discord, Zoom, Chrome, OBS) selects "DesktopBuddy - Camera" as its webcam, the indicator turns **red** and the in-game camera starts rendering automatically. Click the indicator to manually disable/enable the camera.

### Virtual Microphone

Next to the camera indicator is a **green** mic indicator. It captures spatial in-game audio from an AudioListener positioned at the panel. The audio is routed to VB-Cable's "CABLE Output" virtual microphone. Click the indicator to **mute/unmute** — it turns dark red when muted.

In Discord/Zoom, select **"CABLE Output"** as your microphone to share in-game audio.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10+ with an NVIDIA or AMD GPU
- [Resonite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2519830/Resonite/) with [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader)

### For building from source

- .NET 10 SDK
- Windows SDK 10.0.19041.0+ (for `fxc.exe` shader compiler)
- Visual Studio 2019+ Build Tools (for SoftCam DLL compilation)

## Building

```
scripts/build.bat -r
```

Builds the mod and restarts Resonite. The build process:
1. Compiles the HLSL compute shader (if `fxc.exe` available)
2. Builds the mod DLL with ILRepack (merges all managed dependencies)
3. Deploys to Resonite: `rml_mods/`, `ffmpeg/`, `cloudflared/`, `softcam/`, `vbcable/`

Add `-d` for desktop mode: `scripts/build.bat -r -d`

## Packaging

```
scripts/package.bat
```

Creates `DesktopBuddy.zip` containing:

- `rml_mods/DesktopBuddy.dll` — the mod (all managed deps merged)
- `ffmpeg/` — FFmpeg shared libraries (MPEG-TS muxing)
- `cloudflared/` — Cloudflare Tunnel binary (remote streaming)
- `softcam/` — Virtual camera DirectShow filter (32-bit + 64-bit)
- `vbcable/` — VB-Cable virtual audio driver and installer

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Areas where help is especially needed:

- **Linux support** — WGC is Windows-only, needs PipeWire/XDG portal capture + VA-API encoding
- **Code review** — if you spot anything, please open an issue or PR
